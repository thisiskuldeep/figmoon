# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Repository name: `figmoon`
4. Description: `A modern web application for generating Figma design system components`
5. Make it **Public** (recommended for open source projects)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/thisiskuldeep/figmoon.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Setup

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/thisiskuldeep/figmoon`
2. You should see all your files there
3. The repository should be live and accessible

## Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)

To make your app live on the web:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
6. Click "Save"
7. Your app will be available at: `https://thisiskuldeep.github.io/figmoon`

## Repository Structure

Your repository contains:
- `index.html` - Main application file
- `styles.css` - Application styling
- `script.js` - Application logic
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules

## Next Steps

After setting up the repository, you can:
1. Share the repository URL with others
2. Accept contributions through pull requests
3. Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests
4. Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing (if needed)
